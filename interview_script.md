---

## ✅ SIMPLE QUESTIONS

### **Q1**
**Interviewer:** Let’s start simple — which country tops the happiness list in this report?

**Claude:** That would be **Finland**, with a happiness score of **7.769**. They've been consistently leading the charts for several years.

---

### **Q2**
**Interviewer:** And on the other end — who’s unfortunately at the bottom?

**Claude:** **South Sudan**, with a score of **2.853**. The country has faced ongoing conflict and economic hardship, which reflects in its happiness ranking.

---

### **Q3**
**Interviewer:** How many countries are represented in this dataset?

**Claude:** The dataset includes **156** countries.

---

### **Q4**
**Interviewer:** What’s the average happiness score across all these countries?

**Claude:** The global average is around **5.41**. So, countries scoring above that can be considered relatively happier than the global norm.

---

### **Q5**
**Interviewer:** Interesting. Which 5 countries have the highest *GDP per capita*?

**Claude:** Here's the top 5:
1. **Qatar** (1.684)  
2. **Luxembourg** (1.609)  
3. **Singapore** (1.572)  
4. **United Arab Emirates** (1.503)  
5. **Kuwait** (1.500)

---

### **Q6**
**Interviewer:** Out of all the factors, which one is most positively linked with happiness?

**Claude:** **GDP per capita** shows the strongest correlation — around **0.794** — with happiness. More wealth per person tends to predict higher happiness, generally.

---

### **Q7**
**Interviewer:** What about life expectancy — what’s the average?

**Claude:** The average *healthy life expectancy* across all countries is approximately **0.725** (normalized score).

---

### **Q8**
**Interviewer:** Who’s the most generous country according to this report?

**Claude:** **Myanmar** stands out, with a generosity score of **0.566**.

---

## 🔍 COMPLEX QUESTIONS

### **Q9**
**Interviewer:** If a country wants to boost its happiness score by 1 point, which single factor should it invest in first — and why?

**Claude:** Definitely **GDP per capita**. It has the strongest positive correlation and varies significantly between countries — so increasing it can have a high payoff.

---

### **Q10**
**Interviewer:** Can you rank the six main factors by how much they contribute to happiness?

**Claude:** Sure! Based on correlation:
1. GDP per capita — 0.794  
2. Healthy life expectancy — 0.780  
3. Social support — 0.777  
4. Freedom to make life choices — 0.567  
5. Perceptions of corruption — 0.386  
6. Generosity — 0.076

---

### **Q11**
**Interviewer:** Which country is the *best all-rounder* if we normalize and average all six contributing factors equally?

**Claude:** That would be **Singapore** — it performs well across all dimensions.

---

### **Q12**
**Interviewer:** Are there any generous countries that aren’t exactly happy?

**Claude:** Yes — countries like **Myanmar**, **Haiti**, **Kenya**, **Gambia**, **Syria**, and **Comoros** rank high in generosity but have below-average happiness scores.

---

### **Q13**
**Interviewer:** Is there a clear *social support threshold* above which countries tend to be happier?

**Claude:** Yes — countries with social support ≥ **1.44** tend to have happiness scores above **7**. That seems to be a strong threshold.

---

### **Q14**
**Interviewer:** Any patterns between corruption perceptions and happiness?

**Claude:** Yes — there’s a **positive correlation** of about **0.386**. Countries perceived as less corrupt are generally happier.

---

### **Q15**
**Interviewer:** Are there outliers — countries that are happier than their GDP would suggest?

**Claude:** Definitely! Countries like **Costa Rica**, **Finland**, **Somalia**, **Guatemala**, **Nicaragua**, and others show higher happiness than predicted by GDP alone — likely due to strong social support or freedom.

---

### **Q16**
**Interviewer:** Last one — if I’m advising low-happiness countries, where should we start improving?

**Claude:** Again, **GDP per capita** is your best bet. The gap between the top 10 and bottom 20 countries is widest there, so improving that can yield big gains.
